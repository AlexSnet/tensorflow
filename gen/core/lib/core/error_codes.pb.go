	//      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
	//  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
	//      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
	//      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
	//      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
	//      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
	//  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
	//      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
	//      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
	//      read-modify-write on the same resource.

	// system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an
	// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
	// OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current
	// file size.
	//
	// There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and
	// OUT_OF_RANGE.  We recommend using OUT_OF_RANGE (the more specific
